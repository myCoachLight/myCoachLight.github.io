Dear Residents:
<br><br>
When using the Laundry facilities make sure you clean up after yourselves.
<br><br>
1.	Clean out the Lint Basket when you are done drying.<br>
2.	Check machines to make sure you have all your clothes.<br>
3.	Throw all garbage in the trash, and not on the floor.<br>
4.	No eating, drinking, smoking or playing in the basement.<br>
5.	Do not leave laundry in the machine unattended or overnight.<br>
6.	The sink is specifically for the clothes and not to wash dishes.<br>
<br><br>
Let’s try to keep our Laundry Room clean
