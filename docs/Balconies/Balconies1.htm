Dear Residents:
<br><br>
The weather changes quickly, autumn and soon winter.  We are asking every resident to keep clean the balcony and patio areas.
<br><br>
Durring early fall, remove all the plants and toys from railings and wood area.  
Stack the lawn chairs and put them securely against the wall.  
Cover the grill.
<br><br>
Please keep this area clean at all times.  
If you do not remove the plants and the objects, they will be thrown into the trash because they can cause damage to the wood and the replacement cost is very high.  Remember, all these expenses go to your monthly assessment.
